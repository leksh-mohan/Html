      <p>The Met Department has issued <b>red alert for eight districts </b> — Chennai, Tiruvallur, Ranipet, Vellore,
        Salem,
        Kallakurichi, Tirupattur and Tiruvannamalai — on November 11 as extremely heavy rainfall measuring above 20.4 cm
        is expected in one or two places and very heavy to heavy rainfall in a few places.</p>

      <p>Rain may be of heavy to very heavy intensity over 11 districts including Kancheepuram, Chengalpattu, Cuddalore,
        Dharmapuri and the UnionTerritory of Puducherry. Many other places may record rainfall of varying intensity.</p>

      <h4><i>4.30 pm | Tamil Nadu</i></h4>
      <p>Depression to cross near Chennai late evening</p>

      <p>The latest weather bulletin issued by IMD at 2.30 pm states the depression is about 80 km east-southeast of
        Chennai and 140 km east-northeast of Puducherry. It is likely to move northwards and cross between northern
        Tamil Nadu and southern Andhra Pradesh coasts near Chennai by 8.30 pm. Also another intense cloud mass has
        developed over the northeast sector due to convergence in the northeasterly winds.</p>

      <p>The Met Department has also said a fresh low pressure area is likely to form over South Andaman Sea and
        neighbourhood on November 13. It is likely to move west-northwest wards and become more marked during subsequent
        48 hours.</p>

      <p>With the release of water from dams in South Arcot district in neighbouring Tamil Nadu, the Sankarabarani river
        in Puducherry was in a spate.</p>
